Richelle Coppin
Jacie Moninghoff

Only outside resources were past projects and assorted c++ reference pages.

As far as we know, our baby name analyzer is fully functional. Tests for reading are very exhaustive, tests for writing are satisfactory.

Both the readers and the writers were coded using partnered programming. Richelle psuedocoded CSVReader, Jacie pseudocoded both Writers. Both partners wrote tests and fixed bugs throughout.

Jacie wrote psuedocode and logic for main, specifically the maps and the math for the baby name analyzer. 

Richelle ensured that files would parse in to main from the command line and be read in to the database properly.
